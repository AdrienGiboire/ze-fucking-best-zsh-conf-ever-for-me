This came out of a rage after being way too bothered by init time of a couple of seconds. I spend my life in the terminal. I could not take it anymore.

Starting from nothing. Slowly building up. You should do the same. Only read others' rc files for inspiration. You need to understand what you use.

I am happily opened to suggestions.
